# Game-4
Game-4 project for COMP55

This is a java based open world exploration sandbox game. 
In this game the player fights enemies and explores castles to collect more items.
There is a secret item from defeating the boss.

The game is in a complete state (all features have been implemented), but there can always be more things to add. For example:

A better magic system

More items

More enemies

More structures

You can play the game by downloading the game4_final_final.zip folder, extracting it, and running the jar
